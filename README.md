# CNN-FWI

CNN-EFWI is a repository for elastic full waveform inversion at the framework of PyTorch. 

You can use it to perform acoustic or elastic forward modelling and backpropagation in 2D or 3D case, it can simulate wave propagation to generate seismic synthetic data, invert for the acoustic/elastic parameters of undergrond.

In addition, I reparametric the models by neural network to improve the robust of The inversion.

The base code of the repository is from https://github.com/lidongzh/TorchFWI

## examples of CNN-FWI is in the "src" directory

Thank you for your star.
